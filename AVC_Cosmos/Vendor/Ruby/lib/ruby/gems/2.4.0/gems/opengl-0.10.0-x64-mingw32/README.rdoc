== Description

An OpenGL wrapper for Ruby. opengl contains bindings for OpenGL.

Be sure to check out
{GLU}[https://github.com/larskanis/glu] and
{GLUT}[https://github.com/larskanis/glut]
gems.

== Features and Problems

* available for Windows, Linux and OS X

== Synopsis

  require 'opengl'
  FIX (code sample of usage)

== Requirements

* Ruby 1.9.2+
* OpenGL runtime libraries installed

== Install

  gem install opengl

== Developers

After checking out the source, run:

  bundle install

This will install missing dependencies.

== Tests

Run the tests with:

  rake test

Note that the tests have the adverse effect of testing the underlying OpenGL implementation, so depending on your GL provider, drivers or OS, the tests may fail, crash, or not run at all, without affecting your ability to use the bindings.

Tests require both glut and glu gem.

With our test suite, we were able to uncover and help fix upstream mesa bugs:

* {#61026}[https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=61026] glBitmap segfault
* {#61003}[https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=61003] gluSurface with Nurbs spits out debug code
* {#61395}[https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=61395] glEdgeFlag can't be set to false

Whenever a test or example fails, it should be quickly ported into a simple C test program, so we can determine whether it's a bug in the bindings or the OpenGL implementation.

== Cross compiling for Windows

A cross compiled opengl gem can be build per {rake-compiler-dock}[https://github.com/rake-compiler/rake-compiler-dock] for the Windows platform.
There are no runtime dependencies to any but the standard Windows DLLs.
Run <tt>rake gem:windows</tt> and find the gem files in the +pkg+ directory.
