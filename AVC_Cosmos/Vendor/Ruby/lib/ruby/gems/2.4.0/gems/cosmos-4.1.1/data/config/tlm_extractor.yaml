DELIMITER:
  summary: Specify an alternative column delimiter over the default tab character
  parameters:
    - name: Delimiter
      required: true
      description: Character or string to use as a delimiter. For example ','.
      values: .+
FILL_DOWN:
  summary: Insert a value into every row of the output
  description: Telemetry Grapher produces an output file with columns for each
    item name. If you are graphing items from different packets, only the columns
    with items from that packet are populated with values. Fill down causes a
    particular item column to be populated with the previous value so every column
    is 'filled'. This makes it easier to graph multiple values across packets in Excel.
DOWNSAMPLE_SECONDS:
  summary: Downsample data to only output a value every X seconds of time
  parameters:
    - name: Seconds
      required: true
      desription: Number of seconds to skip between values output
      values: \d+
MATLAB_HEADER:
  summary: Prepend the Matlab comment symbol of '%' to the header lines in the output file
UNIQUE_ONLY:
  summary: Only output a row if one of the extracted values has changed
  description: This keyword is useful to extract telemetry items over a large time
    period by only outputting those values where items have changed
UNIQUE_IGNORE:
  summary: Used in conjunction with UNIQUE_ONLY to control which items should be checked
    for changing values
  description: This list of telemetry items (not target names or packet names)
    always includes the COSMOS metadata items named RECEIVED_TIMEFORMATTED and RECEIVED_SECONDS.
    This is because these items will always change from packet to packet which would
    cause them to ALWAYS be printed if UNIQUE_ONLY was used. To avoid this,
    but still include time stamps in the output, UNIQUE_IGNORE includes these items.
    Use this keyword if you have a similar telemetry item that you want to display
    in the output but not be used to determine uniqueness.
  parameters:
    - name: Item Name
      required: true
      description: Name of the item to exclude from the uniqueness criteria.
        Note that all items with this name in all target packets are affected.
      values: .+
SHARE_COLUMNS:
  summary: Export telemetry items with the same name into the same column
  description: Normally items from different packets are put in their own column
    in the output. If this keyword is used, items with the same name in different
    packets will now share one column in the output. This applies to all telemetry
    items with identical names. If you want to share columns for only specific items,
    use the SHARE_COLUMN keyword instead.
SHARE_COLUMN:
  summary: Export telemetry items with the same name into the same column
  description: Normally items from different packets are put in their own column
    in the output. This keyword is used to specify specific items that are from different
    packets but should share one column in the output. This applies to all telemetry
    items with identical names. If you want to share columns for all duplicate item
    names in different packets, use the SHARE_COLUMNS keyword instead.
  since: 3.9.2
  parameters:
    - name: Item Name
      required: true
      description: Name of the telemtry item
      values: .+
    - name: Item Type
      required: false
      description: Type of the telemetry item
      values: ['CONVERTED', 'RAW', 'FORMATTED', 'WITH_UNITS']
FULL_COLUMN_NAMES:
  summary: Use TARGET PACKET ITEM as the column header for each column
  description: Normally just the item name is used as the column header but this
    adds the target and packet name. Note that the TARGET and PACKET columns
    are not generated when this mode is active since the items are fully qualified.
DONT_OUTPUT_FILENAMES:
  summary: Don't output the list of input filenames at the top of each output file
TEXT:
  summary: Insert arbitrary text in the Telemetry Extractor output
  description: Text also allows you to dynamically create Excel formulas using a special syntax
  parameters:
    - name: Header
      required: true
      description: The column header text
      values: .+
    - name: Text
      required: true
      description: Text to put in the output file. The special character '%' will
        be translated to the current row of the output file. This is useful for
        Excel formulas which need a reference to a cell. Remember the first two
        columns are typically the TARGET and PACKET and telemetry items start in
        column 'C' in Excel.
ITEM:
  summary: Specify a telemetry item to extract
  parameters:
    - name: Target Name
      required: true
      description: Name of the telemetry target
      values: <%= System.targets.keys %>
    - name: Packet Name
      required: true
      description: Name of the telemetry packet
      values: .+
    - name: Item Name
      required: true
      description: Name of the telemetry item
      values: .+
    - name: Item Type
      required: false
      description: Type of the telemetry item
      values: ['CONVERTED', 'RAW', 'FORMATTED', 'WITH_UNITS']
